# Project AI Docs

Structured context the AI assistant reads to work on this project, so it does not rediscover the codebase each session. AIDD generates this folder and keeps it in sync.

## What lives here

- `memory/`: the project memory bank loaded each session. See [`memory/README.md`](memory/README.md).
- `INSTALL.md`: the technical vision, the stack decisions, the audit results, and the install guide. The source the memory bank was distilled from.
- `recipes/`: project-specific how-to recipes created or updated by the cook skill.
- `GUIDELINES.md`: how this team operates the AI on this project.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: how to add or change project context.
- `tasks/`: specs, plans, and run summaries, created as work happens.

The `<aidd_project_memory>` block inside each AI context file (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and the rest) is generated and kept in sync, never edited by hand. To change what the AI sees, add or remove files under `memory/`. See [`memory/README.md`](memory/README.md) for the load tiers and the current file index.

## The framework

AIDD ships skills, agents, rules, and generators as a plugin marketplace. For the full catalog, the install guide, and the end-to-end workflow, see the framework docs: <https://github.com/ai-driven-dev/framework>.
